## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Professional green (#38A3A5) for a fresh, trustworthy feel. A shade neither too bright nor too muted evokes competence.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), very desaturated, providing a clean and professional backdrop that allows the green elements to stand out without being overpowering.
- Accent color: Complementary light blue (#79C7C5), 30 degrees away on the color wheel, offering a gentle contrast. More saturated than the background but lighter than the primary.
- Font pairing: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines. 'PT Sans' provides readability, and 'Playfair' injects elegance without sacrificing clarity.
- Use minimalist line icons for a clean and modern look.
- Implement a responsive grid layout for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
